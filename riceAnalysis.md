### Basic Analysis
- Contour Tracing
- Orientation (would be nice to define the vertical top based on the position of the missing embryo)
- No. & Position Info of **Cracks**("|")
- No. & Position Info of **Islands**("*")
- No. & Position Info of **Faults**("<")

### Interpreter Values
- **num horizontal lines** ("_")
- **vertical lines** ("|") 
- **line intersections** ("+") 
- **lonely islands** ("*")


no text influence
- **fault** ("º")
- **intersected islands** ("ø")


### Pattern Analysis
- Possible to tell the difference between `*|*` and `|**` (or even `**|` if a coordination can be set)?

### Text Cases
| No.  | Name of Pattern | Symbol | Example |Text|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |The Branches| \|= | p6_rice25, p6_rice39 |a vertical crack cut across multiple horizontal cracks in the middle of the surface, foretells a journey filled with many paths and possibilities.|
| 2 |The Indecisive heart| -_ | p1_rice12, p6_rice17|multiple half cracks that don't crack through the whole grain, a decision needs to be made so that the right path shall reveal|
| 3 | The Delicate Heart|* |p9_rice4, p9_rice6| warns of fragility and the need for cau tion and obstacles to be overcome.|
| 4 |The Converging/Diverging Paths| \|/|p01_rice09, p6_rice9|two lines meet in sharp angle, speaks of unexpected allies and the coming together of forces|
| 5 |Curvy lines | ~ |p5_rice30|scattered curvy paths with unclear direction or tendency|
| 6 |Hidden Balance| **| p7_rice9 | two inner cracks that doesn't penetrate towards the surface(), a hidden but fragile balance is achieved at the current moment |
| 7 |The Mist| () |p2_rice2, p2_rice3| no clear sign cracks with uneven surface. The destiny is not set, everything is possible (no cracks/no island/no fault)|
| 8 |The Fragile Stem| - |p3_rice11 |a thin subtle crack that doesnt crack through, warns of a lean season ahead.|
| 9 |The Clustered Five| \|\|\|\|\| |p4_rice39, p5_rice2 |tightly packed on a single piece of rice, speaks of a crowded and bustling time to come.|
| 10 |The Broken Cloud| ? |p1_rice26 |rough and uneven surface, speaks of challenges and obstacles. (can identify sth but doesn't fill into any category)|
| 11 |The Divider| \| |p4_rice26, p4_rice38|a clear horizontal crack the separate the grain into two almost identical halves, an indicator of a clear division that needs to be made|
| 12 |The Libra|*\|* |p8_rice9|two subtle signs of cracks split by a clear divider crack, showing a struggle between two things|
| 13 |The Teller| < |p2_rice19,p2_rice41, p3_rice16|a clear single crack the opens like a telling mouth, unspoken words need to be told and heard, the bigger the opening, the more needs to be shared|
| 14 |Mirror| \| \| |p4_rice37, p6_rice1| Two evenly distributed cracks, as if they are mirroring each other|
| 15 |The Three Parallels| \|\|\| |p5_rice37 | |
| 16 |Four cracks| \|\|\|\| | p7_rice41|sth bad?|
