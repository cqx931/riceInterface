### Basic Analysis
- Contour Tracing
- Orientation (would be nice to define the vertical top based on the position of the missing embryo)
- No. & Position Info of **Cracks**("|")
- No. & Position Info of **Islands**("*")
- No. & Position Info of **Faults**("<")

### Pattern Analysis
- Possible to tell the difference between "*|*" and "|**" (or even "**|" if a coordination can be set)?

### Text Cases
- TBA
